# About Me GUI

Every since I had taken the APCS course, I found an evergrwoing passion for computer science.
The course helped me develop a basic foundation for Java and I extended this to other categories worthwhile to learn.
I've stumbled upon the topic of GUI development and found it highly interesting. 

Therefore, I decided to create these series of JFrames to both introduce myself and to improve my skill in GUI development.

-The login page includes... </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) an interactive background where it allows the user to create <span>star constellations </span>with just few clicks! </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) clickable image icons to open webpages such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) an error message and reset password textbox when there is a login error. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) the use of the preference API to store memory of the checkbox and remembers the user's input of username/password when enetered correctly. </br>
