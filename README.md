# About Me GUI

Every since I had taken the APCS course, I found an evergrowing passion for computer science.
The course helped me develop a basic foundation for Java and I extended this to other categories worthwhile to learn.
I've stumbled upon the topic of GUI development and found it highly interesting. 

Therefore, I decided to create these series of JFrames to both introduce myself and to improve my skill in GUI development.</br></br>
<strong>Note: </strong> main.java found in GUI/src/profile is still in development! wang.java is merely a substitution at this point! It is also undergoing construction.

-Properties and capabilities of the cropping panel protocol ... </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) allows the user to choose an image on their computer. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) allows the user to choose the size of their cropped picture with an interactive alpha blue colored rectangle. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) creates a folder with the cropped image. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) has a refresh button for an instant result of uploading the cropped image onto the JLabel. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>FLAWS: </strong>None of the files or folders may be moved or else the program will NOT run. The only image you can move and delete is the picture that you chose as the main picture to be cropped.
