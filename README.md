# About Me GUI

Every since I had taken the APCS course, I found an evergrowing passion for computer science.
The course helped me develop a basic foundation for Java and I extended this to other categories worthwhile to learn.
I've stumbled upon the topic of GUI development and found it highly interesting. 

Therefore, I decided to create these series of JFrames to both introduce myself and to improve my skill in GUI development.</br></br>
<strong>Note: </strong> main.java found in GUI/src/profile is still in development! wang.java is merely a substitution at this point! It is also undergoing construction.


## Login Page </br>
The login page includes... </br>
1) an interactive background where it allows the user to create <span>star constellations </span>with just few clicks! </br>
2) clickable image icons to open webpages such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. </br>
3) an error message and reset password textbox when there is a login error. </br>
2) the use of the preference API to store memory of the checkbox and remembers the user's input of username/password when enetered correctly. </br>

## Cropping Image Panel (healthyeating) </br>
-Properties and capabilities of the cropping panel protocol ... </br>
1) allows the user to choose an image on their computer. </br>
2) allows the user to choose the size of their cropped picture with an interactive alpha blue colored rectangle. There is also a maximum width and height for the cropped image which can be controlled with the JTextField (must press the "enter" button to update the crop size).</br>
3) creates a folder with the cropped image. </br>
4) remembers the uploaded image so that when the program is disposed and reopened, the updated croppped image is present on the display panel. </br>
5) has a refresh button for an instant result of uploading the cropped image onto the JLabel. The refresh button allows the user to alternate between the previous picture and the currently cropped picture. This built in preference allows the user to compare the two pictures to see which piece looks better! </br> </br>

<strong>FLAWS: </strong>None of the files or folders may be moved or else the program will NOT run. The only image you can move and delete is the picture that you chose as the main picture to be cropped. This program is also not efficeint with much larger images. The program also only allows for one crop per execution. </br></br>
<strong>Next Steps: </strong> Have the cropped image saved in the program itself so that the user does not have to have random folders and images laying around in their desktop. This would also be useful for USB drive users since they would not have to constantly upload their cropped picture with every unique computers they use.
